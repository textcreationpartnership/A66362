            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the Parliament, out of their love to Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Reverend Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops his Servants, humbly moved his Majeſty for ſome augmentation to be made to the means of divers of them; and had omitted the Biſhop of <hi>Oſſory</hi> out of their Liſt, as a man that
<pb facs="tcp:36873:5"/> either needed it not, or cared not for it, ſeeing he never moved any man, as ſome others did, to ſeek for any augmentation for him: Your Grace was the only Advocate to put his Majeſty in mind of the Biſhop of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> and to add four hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> for his augmentation, to the perpetual Obligation of the preſent and ſucceeding Biſhops of that See, to your Grace, and to all your ſucceeding Family.</p>
                  <p>But what your Grace hath then ſo graciouſly begun, I humbly beg your Grace would be pleaſed, as graciouſly now to finiſh and perfect that <hi>pious</hi> work which you have ſo religiouſly begun; not ſo much in regard of my ſelf, who, (after I was caſt down to the duſt, and there lay wallowing a long while, and was at laſt, beyond my deſert, and any certainty of expectation, lifted up again to mine Office, and reſtored to mine Honour and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) have vowed and reſolved to ſpend what God hath reſtored to me, for the Honour of God, and the ſervice of the Church of Chriſt, that is, beſides my neceſſities, to repair his Church, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb facs="tcp:36873:5"/> the diſtreſſed, to puniſh perjurers and ſuch high Malefactors,<note n="*" place="margin">Which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the relieving of the diſtreſſed</note> and to do my beſt to hinder any man that fought againſt that moſt Excellent pious King, <hi>Charles the Firſt,</hi> under the Standard of the Beaſt, to carry away, and injoy any part of the inheritance of the Church of Chriſt for his reward, for that tranſcendent wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I ſpent already about four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds in repairing the ruinous Cathedral, and above three hundred pounds more in ſeeking the right of the Church out of the hands of Huck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and the Adverſaries of <hi>King Charles the Firſt:</hi> And I do profeſs, that having food and rayment, and to defray my neceſſary occaſions, I weigh not one ſtraw, either of mine augmentation, or of any other ſupportation that I have:<note n="†" place="margin">I dare take my oath, I am not, to this day, one penny the richer for my Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick: When as the repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Church and Biſhops houſe, the Suits in Law to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the Biſhoprick, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of my Books, for the ſervice of the Church, and the good of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed all that I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> God is, <hi>El Shaddai,</hi> a God all-ſuficient for me, as he hath been hitherto.</p>
                  <p>But I beg this of your Grace, in reſpect of the poor See of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> and the ſucceeding Biſhops, that perhaps ſhall not paſs through ſo many ſtorms as I have done, and therefore ſhall not be ſo well
<pb facs="tcp:36873:6"/> able to abide the weather, and to endure the wants that I did, but will be moſt willing to do God that good ſervice, which God and ſuch good men as the King and your Grace will inable them to do.</p>
                  <p>And I doubt not, but as your Grace hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been ſo ſweet a Friend, and ſo bountiful a Benefactor and Patron, both to my ſelf, and many more of the Servants of Christ; ſo your Grace, without any motion of mine, will do far better things, and things far better then I can preſcribe or imagine.</p>

                  <p>And ſo you ſee, here is <hi>ſententia brevis,</hi> a ſhort ſpeech, but <hi>materia uberrima,</hi> an Ocean of matter to ſail over.

                  <p>And therefore we ſhould never <hi>exalt</hi> our ſelves with high conceits of our <hi>own worth,</hi> like the <hi>proud Phariſee;</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fall down upon our knees with the <hi>humble Publican,</hi> and ſay, Lord <hi>be merciful unto me a ſinner:</hi> and to cry out with the Prodigal Child, <hi>we have ſinned againſt Heaven and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, and we are no more worthy to be called thy Sons.</hi> For if God ſhould enter into judgement, and be <hi>extream</hi> to mark what we do amiſs, <hi>O Lord, who could abide it?</hi> For no fleſh living could be <hi>juſtified.</hi>

                  <p>But though <hi>Kings</hi> and Princes ſhould <hi>inviolably</hi> obſerve their words in their Pardons <hi>granted</hi> unto Rebels and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and other Malefactors;<note place="margin">Not to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and favour thoſe that have been Traytors: and why.</note> yet as <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> anſwered <hi>Laſthenes,</hi> that betrayed the City of <hi>Olynthum,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> ſaid to <hi>Rymetalces</hi> King of <hi>Thracia,</hi> that had forſaken <hi>Antonius,</hi> to joyn with him, that he loved the <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> that did him <hi>good,</hi> but he could not endure the <hi>Traytor</hi> that betrayed his <hi>Master.</hi> And <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> was of the ſame minde, but that he joyned <hi>cruelty</hi> with his <hi>hatred</hi> unto the Traytors; for when he had inticed many Captains of <hi>Piſcennius Niger,</hi> his Competitor of the Empire, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe their <hi>Maſters ſecrets,</hi> and had ſerved his turn of them, and ſettled his affairs, he made <hi>all thoſe Traytors,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Herod. l. <hi>3</hi>
                     </note> and their children alſo to be put to death, as <hi>Herodian</hi> writeth. So the wiſeſt men conceived that they ought not to <hi>countenance</hi> and favour thoſe that had been <hi>Traytors</hi> unto other Princes; though they had done good ſervice unto them: and that for theſe three reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For that he which hath turned <hi>one leaf</hi> can turn <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and he that hath betrayed my <hi>Father,</hi> may upon the like hopes and ſurmiſes betray <hi>me</hi> likewiſe; and he that hath been a Rebel, knows the way to become <hi>a</hi> Rebel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For that this <hi>honouring</hi> and <hi>magnifying</hi> of Rebels and Traytors to <hi>former Princes,</hi> for their good ſervice done to <hi>latter Maſters,</hi> may prove to be an <hi>encouragement</hi> for others to become Rebels and Traytors in like manner againſt their Kings. For when amongſt <hi>many</hi> thouſands of Rebels, they ſee but <hi>few</hi> puniſhed, the <hi>reſt</hi> pardoned, and many of them <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured</hi> and <hi>preferred,</hi> why may not the <hi>ſeditions</hi> think, that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:36873:53"/> they ſhall either prevail; or if miſs of their enterpriſe, they may eſcape the <hi>fortune</hi> of thoſe few that ſhall be puniſhed, and be <hi>magnified</hi> like thoſe that they do ſee thus rewarded?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For that this favouring and countenancing of thoſe that <hi>have been</hi> Rebels and falſe, is a great offence and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement</hi> to thoſe that have ever continued faithful and loyal, eſpecially if they ſee themſelves poſtponed and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> that I told you of, thought it neither <hi>wiſdom</hi> nor <hi>policy</hi> to regard and favour thoſe, whom they <hi>pardoned</hi> for their <hi>treachery</hi> to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Princes, though they had done never ſo <hi>good ſervice</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves; and if all Kings did ſo, I believe <hi>fewer</hi> Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors would ſpring up among the people.</p>
                  <p>And this appeareth <hi>plainly</hi> by our new <hi>Plotters</hi> of <hi>Rebellions</hi> and <hi>Treaſons</hi> now amongſt us in this Kingdom of <hi>Ireland;</hi> for <hi>who</hi> and <hi>what</hi> are they that <hi>doe thus</hi> murmur and mutter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt both <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Anointed,</hi> the King and his Lieutenant, the Church and Common-wealth?

                  </p>
                  <p>And what <hi>wayes</hi> do they take for this, but the very ſame which they had <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>practiſed</hi> before in <hi>England</hi> under the <hi>Long-Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. To <hi>tax</hi> and to <hi>traduce</hi> the <hi>good King</hi> for doing that they know not, nor ever ſhall be able to prove that he did; but the <hi>Scots</hi> ſay that he did: and ſo they do ſay a <hi>thouſand things</hi> more then I <hi>believe</hi> to be true: and they ſhould believe <hi>nothing,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially what they <hi>know not,</hi> againſt their King, when as <hi>all</hi> other men, that are both <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>honeſt,</hi> can <hi>ſufficiently</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and juſtifie all that ever his now Majeſty did. And I, that am not <hi>worthy</hi> to be of his counſel, and to know the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> of his actions; yet could ſhew you very <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>ſufficient</hi> reaſons for <hi>every</hi> thing that ever I heard his Majeſty did: and I would do it, but that <hi>Himſelf</hi> and his <hi>Council,</hi> I know, can juſtifie <hi>all his actions,</hi> with many <hi>far deeper reaſons</hi> then I can dive into.</p>
                  <p>Therefore theſe very <hi>firebrands</hi> of ſedition, knowing this, would a little excuſe his Majeſty, by laying the faults upon his <hi>Counſellors,</hi> that ſeduced him. And who are they? They ſpeak in general, <hi>&amp; in univerſalibus latet error;</hi> ſo did the <hi>long Parliament</hi> againſt our late King: there they learned their <hi>leſſon,</hi> and they walk in the ſame paths. But the former <hi>Parliaments</hi> could name their names, the <hi>Duke of Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> ſo can <hi>theſe men</hi> name the <hi>Duke of Ormond.</hi> And what hath he done? I obſerve two things that they charge him with.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To <hi>teſtifie</hi> what he knew to be <hi>truth,</hi> and theſe men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be otherwiſe; A <hi>mighty</hi> fault! becauſe they had not their eyes <hi>open</hi> to ſee the truth, his <hi>Grace</hi> offended to <hi>teſtifie</hi> the truth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In obeying his Majeſty's <hi>gracious goodneſs,</hi> by <hi>relieving</hi> thoſe that were <hi>neceſſitous,</hi> and perhaps, for ought that they know, had done his Majeſty <hi>very good ſervice,</hi> and, for ought that we know, had done no <hi>injury</hi> to any of our men; and this is a ſin <hi>unpardonable</hi> with theſe <hi>uncharitable</hi> men. I, but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:36873:54"/> they will ſay, by relieving <hi>theſe</hi> he lets the <hi>Army</hi> ſtarve: and I demand, what <hi>Subject</hi> ever did pawn his own <hi>lands,</hi> melt his own <hi>plate,</hi> lay out his own <hi>moneys</hi> to relieve the King's <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> and to ſhew himſelf, I will not ſay <hi>more faithful,</hi> but I ſay, <hi>neer ſo faithful</hi> to his King, and ſo bountiful a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor and friend <hi>to all the King's loyal Subjects,</hi> as the <hi>Duke of Ormond</hi> hath alwayes been? I muſt, and ever will, with all thankfulneſs acknowledge it; when the <hi>long Parliament</hi> and their <hi>whelps</hi> had robbed me of all that I had, all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and ſubſiſtence, which I had from <hi>all the friends</hi> in the world, was that <hi>bountiful gift,</hi> which this <hi>noble Duke</hi> ſent me by Sir <hi>George Lane:</hi> And I could name <hi>the many many more,</hi> to whom his <hi>Grace</hi> did the like; And are theſe things, faults worthy to be reproved? And I am ſure he hated the <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and diſowned the <hi>Rebels</hi> of this Nation as much or more then any man: and would you have him to be an enemy to the <hi>poſtnati,</hi> and a ſtranger to the <hi>innocent?</hi> God hath made him a more <hi>honourable,</hi> and a more <hi>gracious</hi> man.</p>
                  <p>I, but we are not yet come to the <hi>quick</hi> the <hi>Engliſh inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,</hi> by the favour of the <hi>Duke</hi> unto the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> of the Court of <hi>Claim,</hi> is much <hi>ſhaken,</hi> and is like to be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred</hi> and left inanimate.</p>
                  <p>But would you have the <hi>Engliſh intereſt</hi> to continue, be it <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong?</hi> or would you have it <hi>ſo</hi> to continue, that God might <hi>bleſs</hi> it, and it to <hi>proſper?</hi> If ſo, then let it be rooted in <hi>juſtice</hi> and eſtabliſhed in <hi>truth;</hi> or otherwiſe, the <hi>breath</hi> of the Lord will <hi>ſcatter</hi> it, and the <hi>wrath</hi> of God will ſoon <hi>deſtroy</hi> it; and inſtead of <hi>bleſſing,</hi> will, as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, bring the <hi>curſe</hi> of God upon you and your Poſterity. And you might <hi>ſee</hi> if you had your eyes <hi>open,</hi> the great <hi>care</hi> of my <hi>L Duke,</hi> and the great <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>diligence</hi> of the Court of <hi>Claim,</hi> to ſearch out the <hi>truth</hi> of every cauſe, that the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſhould not be made <hi>guilty,</hi> nor the nocent carry away the <hi>victory.</hi> And what <hi>more</hi> would you have done?</p>
                  <p>Yet, as I ſaid before, they that have learned the <hi>way</hi> to be Rebels, do <hi>know</hi> the way to be rebellious ſtill.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:36873:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>But eſpecially becauſe <hi>Rebels</hi> and <hi>Traytors</hi> have had their <hi>Preſidents</hi> and examples to chalk and tread out the deſperate pathes of treachery and <hi>rebellion</hi> unto them; becauſe, as the <hi>Poet</hi> ſaith;
<q>Nullum caruit exemplo nefas,</q> You cannot eaſily name the wickedneſs, that I can not <hi>parallel</hi> with the like example, as, If <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Holophernes</hi> were drunk, ſo was <hi>Noah</hi> long before them; If <hi>Oedipus</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted inceſt with <hi>Jocaſta,</hi> ſo did <hi>Lot</hi> commit inceſt with his own daughters, and if <hi>Polynices</hi> kill'd his own brother <hi>Eteocles;</hi> ſo did <hi>Alexander Caracalla</hi> kill his own brother <hi>Getha, Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> killed <hi>Remus,</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> his onely brother <hi>Abel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo the men that became <hi>Rebels</hi> and <hi>Traytors</hi> unto their King, and <hi>murderers</hi> of their Brethren here amongſt us, may alledge, they are not the <hi>firſt that rebelled;</hi> but they can name enough that <hi>murdered</hi> their oppreſſors, which they <hi>onely inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> to do: and they can cite you <hi>great Maſſacres,</hi> and the rooting out of many Potentates, that <hi>Lorded</hi> and <hi>domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> over the poor people; as the <hi>maſſacres</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Cici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Veſpers, the treachery of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and the ſubjects of <hi>Pontus,</hi> that conſpired together, to deſtroy all the <hi>Romans,</hi> that were diſperſed over all the Kingdom of <hi>Pontus;</hi> ſo the <hi>Saxons</hi> became treacherous, and the murderers of all the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Lords, on <hi>Salisburie-plain:</hi> and they ſay the <hi>Iriſh</hi> did the like, to eradicate the <hi>Daues</hi> out of this Kingdom: and they have done no more unto their Oppreſſours.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:36873:55" rendition="simple:additions"/> though we ſhould have never ſo many examples of any evil-doing, yet we ought not to <hi>follow</hi> them; becauſe the Lord tells us plainly, <hi>We ought not to follow a multitude to do evil;</hi> and it is our duty, not to do what <hi>others</hi> do, but what God <hi>commands</hi> us, and all others to do.</p>

                  <p>And how a <hi>greater wickedneſs</hi> could be committed, then that ſo good, ſo pious, and ſo excellent a Prince as King <hi>Charles the firſt,</hi> ſhould be withſtood, rebelled againſt, betrayed, deſerted by his <hi>Engliſh, Scottiſh,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſubjects, (excepting a few noble Lords, and others) that ſtuck unto him, and ſo <hi>cruelly</hi> bemangled him to death, it makes me <hi>ſilent</hi> and <hi>dumb,</hi> that I know not what to ſay, but to pray to God that this <hi>great wickedneſs</hi> be not yet laid to our charge.</p>
                  <p>And Secondly; For the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, it was beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; I ſay, that in many particulars their <hi>ingratitude</hi> was beyond all parallel; for other Nations, as the ſubjects of the King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and the like, that rebelled and murdered all the <hi>Romans</hi> in their dominions, and thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> that rooted out the <hi>Danes,</hi> had ſome kind of colour to do the ſame; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their domineering Lords were <hi>aliens,</hi> and <hi>oppreſſed</hi> them beyond meaſure, as the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> did the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and kept them as <hi>ſlaves</hi> under them; but the late <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels were <hi>Peers,</hi> and as the <hi>chief Lords</hi> of the kingdom, and ſuch <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> of marriages, betwixt the <hi>Engliſh, Britiſh,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and ſuch mutual pledges of <hi>love, amity,</hi> and <hi>familiarity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, that there could not be the <hi>leaſt ſuſpicion</hi> of the leaſt diſtaſt amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>And beſides all this, though there were ſome <hi>penal</hi> Statutes made againſt them; yet they were for the <hi>moſt part</hi> ſuffered to lie <hi>aſleep,</hi> and covered over with many kindneſſes: and they themſelves permitted, as God ſaid of <hi>Adam,</hi> to become <hi>as one of us,</hi> and as <hi>Q.

                     <q>Tros, Tyriuſque mihi nullo diſcrimine agetur.</q> We made no difference of any priviledge amongſt us. And therefore,</p>
                  <p>What a horrible <hi>ingratitude</hi> was it then for ſuch men to riſe, and to rebel, and ſo <hi>maliciouſly</hi> to intend, ſo <hi>inhumanely,</hi> ſo <hi>barbarouſly,</hi> and ſo <hi>cruelly</hi> to root out, and to deſtroy their Neighbours, Friends, and Allies?</p>
                  <p>And eſpecially, to plot ſuch a <hi>miſchievous act,</hi> as they intended ſo <hi>ſubtly,</hi> ſo <hi>ſecretly,</hi> and ſo univerſally as they did?

                  <p n="2">2. God diſcovered theſe ſecret <hi>Plots,</hi> and <hi>Treacheries</hi> of the Rebels, and effected theſe wonderful things, <hi>not onely,</hi> for our ſakes, or onely to get <hi>thanks</hi> and <hi>praiſe</hi> for the <hi>deliverance</hi> of us his ſervants; but alſo to get <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as he faith of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> by the puniſhment and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Adverſaries.

                  <p>And therefore, if men will needs be <hi>ſeditious</hi> and <hi>rebellions,</hi> I would they were like theſe beaſts <hi>full of eyes behind them,</hi> that they might ſee, and <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> conſider, how the juſt God doth <hi>reward,</hi> and <hi>puniſh,</hi> and <hi>plague</hi> theſe <hi>perfidious,</hi> and <hi>perjured</hi> Villains, and how moſt wiſe men deem and deal with them, no otherwiſe, but as <hi>Neclas</hi> did with <hi>Duringus,</hi> and the other wiſe <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> did with thoſe perfidious, and perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Rebels, that I told you of before.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon why they did ſo, was, becauſe they found it unanſwerably true, that the beſt way to <hi>ſecure</hi> their peace, and to eſtabliſh them in their dominions, is to deſtroy, and to root out rebels, and traytors out of their territories.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.23. 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 1.19.</note> For you may read how <hi>Shimei</hi> became a rebel againſt King <hi>David,</hi> and how King <hi>David</hi> pardoned him: Yet he bids King <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to bring his hoary-head to the grave with blood, and ſaith <hi>For thou art a wiſe man, and knoweſt what thou oughteſt to do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Yes, and it was <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> in <hi>David,</hi> at that time, to ſpare him; but now he tells <hi>Solomon,</hi> That when time ſerveth, it ſhould be neither <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> nor <hi>policy</hi> in him to ſpare him; but his <hi>wiſdom</hi> ſhould teach him to deſtroy him; becauſe it is an old Axiom, that, <hi>Qui malus eſt, in eodem genere mali, ſemper praeſumitur eſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi> and experience hath very often found it to be very true, that an oppreſſor, drunkard, or rebel, can as hardly leave his drunkenneſs, or rebellion, as an <hi>Ethiopian can change his black skin, or a leopard his ſpots that are upon his back,</hi> as ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> tells him, that whenſoever he goeth out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he ſhall die: And at the end of three years, two of his ſervants ran away to <hi>Gath,</hi> and he, like an aſſe, ſadleth his aſſe, and followeth after them; then <hi>Solomon</hi> tells him of his <hi>wickedneſs</hi> againſt <hi>King David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">V. 44.</note> and commands <hi>Benaiah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jchoiada,</hi> which fell upon him that he died.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">V. 46.</note>And then it is added in the text, <hi>And the Kingdom was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed in the hand of Solomon.</hi> And was it not eſtabliſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? yes, three full years at leaſt: but never ſo <hi>abſolutely,</hi> and ſo <hi>ſurely,</hi> as now this <hi>old rebel</hi> is taken away: For though he was the <hi>firſt</hi> that ſubmitted himſelf to <hi>King David,</hi> yet it was very <hi>likely,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>ſuſpicious,</hi> that his malice and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill <hi>lurked</hi> in his heart, as <hi>fire</hi> under the <hi>aſhes,</hi> till they found opportunity to break out; and ſo it may be with all others the like rebels whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>And therefore if men will be <hi>rebellious,</hi> it is wiſdom and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 2.12.</note> for the eſtabliſhment of <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> to keep Soldiers, and Garriſons, to keep them under, <hi>in ore gladii,</hi> till all the <hi>old rebels</hi> be quite deſtroyed and extinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>And if men complain of <hi>burthens</hi> and <hi>taxes,</hi> and <hi>impoſitions;</hi> let them blame themſelves, and <hi>thoſe rebels</hi> that cauſed them, and the rebellions diſpoſitions of <hi>them,</hi> that may be juſtly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be the <hi>obſtacles</hi> of <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>tranquillity.</hi>

                  <p>For ſo we read, that the Devil aſſailed ſome of the <hi>beſt Saints,</hi> as Saint <hi>Martin,</hi> Saint <hi>Bernard, Ignatius, Euſebius,</hi> and others; and if theſe things be done <hi>in a green tree,</hi> what ſhall be done <hi>in a withered,</hi> ſaith our Saviour?

<pb facs="tcp:36873:63" rendition="simple:additions"/> and therefore with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> he deſires to be diſſolved, and he longs for death, that he may be with him which was dead, and is alive, and liveth for evermore: and he is well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that his body ſhall go to the grave, that his ſoul may go to glory: and that his fleſh ſhall ſleep in the duſt, that his ſpirit may rejoyce in heaven. And this is the ſtate of the godly man at the day of his death.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, if men would ſeriouſly conſider this before they come to this, then certainly the fear of the moſt fearful death of the wicked, and the love of the moſt comfortable death of the godly, would make them to have ſome care of a Godly life, and to repent them of their wickedneſs.

                  <p>An Attribute is the <hi>Propriety</hi> of the Divine Nature, which cannot be <hi>ſeparated</hi> from the ſame, becauſe it is of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of God, when as <hi>Quicquid in Deo eſt, Deus est,</hi> Whatſoever is in God, is God; and therefore the Divines ſay:</p>

                     <hi>ſed ipſam Eſſentiam Dei,</hi> Thoſe properties not to be any qualities in God, but the very <hi>Eſſence</hi> of God; becauſe the <hi>nature</hi> of God is moſt <hi>ſimple,</hi> and admitteth nothing of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, when as nothing can be <hi>added</hi> unto it, nothing can be <hi>taken</hi> from it: but, as S. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>With him there is no mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, no change, nor ſhadow of turning;</hi> for in God there is nothing either by way of <hi>compoſition,</hi> or by way of <hi>accident,</hi> or by way of <hi>matter</hi> and form; and therefore God is not called <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> as a man is ſo called; for holineſs and juſtice in a man are qualities, but in God they are his <hi>Eſſence;</hi> from whence it cometh to paſs, that God is holy, juſt, and good, without quality; and he is infinite, and immeaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able without quantity: but neither Man, nor Angel can be ſaid to be holy, juſt, good, or great without quality and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity:
<pb facs="tcp:36873:74" rendition="simple:additions"/> Even ſo, God is preſent every where without moving, <hi>Et ſempiternus ſine tempore,</hi> and he is everlaſting and eternal, without time, as being from all eternity before all times, and ſo continuing for ever &amp; ever, when there ſhall be no time. He that would ſee more of this point, let him look into S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> Serm. 80. <hi>in Cant.</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> lib. 5. c. 1. <hi>de Trinit.</hi>

                  <p>And as theſe proprieties are moſt perfectly in God, ſo they are moſt equally in him; for neither is his mercy greater then his juſtice, nor his juſtice any leſs then his mercy becauſe <hi>he maketh not the wicked innocent,</hi>

                  <p>Yet I ſay, that we, by reaſon of our infirmities cannot perceive them to be equally in him; but we perceive his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be far greater then his juſtice, though in God, the one is neither greater nor leſſer, or better then the other.

We muſt obſerve that the proprieties of God are not contrary in God, that is, that there are no contrary propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties in God; for his mercie doth no wayes hinder or oppoſe his juſtice, and his juſtice hindereth not his mercie; but his mercie is juſtice in him, and his juſtice is to ſhew mercie, as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſheweth: becauſe, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith <hi>Serm.</hi> 102. <hi>de tempore,</hi> There are nothing of thoſe things in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, which are capable of contrarieties, leſt God ſhould ſeem to be changeable, who is ever the ſame, without any ſhadow of turning; and therefore, all the proprieties of God being of the Eſſence of God, and the Eſſence of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not contrary to it ſelf, nor any wayes capable of contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, it muſt needs follow that theſe proprieties of God cannot be contrary the one to the other.</p>
                  <p>Yet theſe proprieties may be diverſly conſidered <hi>quoad nos,</hi> in regard of the creatures; becauſe they tend to divers ends: as his mercy tendeth to another end, then his juſtice doth; for,<note place="margin">

                  <p n="2">2.

                     </note> that Chriſt in all theſe reſpects is our <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of the godly, and of the wicked, and of all things elſe, it ſhould teach us this threefold Leſſon.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In regard of the godly, it ſhould teach them humility, obedience, and comfort. 1. Humility, becauſe they are but ſervants; and the Comique ſaith, <hi>Non decet hominem ſervu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum eſſe ſuperbum,</hi> It is a very unſeemly thing, to ſee a proud ſervant of an humble maſter. 2.

Comfort, becauſe they ſerve ſuch a gracious Lord, as taketh pleaſure in the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his ſervants, and will caſe them when they cry unto him,
<pb facs="tcp:36873:80" rendition="simple:additions"/> that they are <hi>weary and heavy laden,</hi>

In regard of the wicked; it ſhould teach them to be aſhamed of their pride and arrogancy, to neglect their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and to flight the Rule and Authority of this their Lord and Maſter. For as of old, when <hi>Moſes</hi> came unto <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the name of the Lord, he proudly anſwered, <hi>Who is the Lord, that I ſhould hear his voice?</hi> And <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> when the three children were brought before him, did moſt arrogantly demand,<note place="margin">Exod. 5.2.</note>

                  <p>Therefore our Saviour firſt of all telleth us, <hi>what we ſhould not do;</hi> that is, not to be <hi>too carefull,</hi> and ſolicitous for the things of this world, but to take heed, and <hi>beware of covetouſneſs;</hi> And to that end he laboureth much, and produceth many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to pluck up, out of our hearts, this evil weed of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs,</hi> which, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>is the root of all wickedneſs.</hi>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:36873:87" rendition="simple:additions"/> and oftentimes better then the daintieſt Diet is to the greateſt Glutton; and the mean man that is clad in Frize, or with <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> in Camels hair, may be, and is, as well preſerved from the heat of Summer, and the cold of Winter, and hath his nakedneſs as well covered thereby, which is all the uſe and end of apparel, as they that are clothed in Purple or Scarlet, or fine Linnen.</p>
                  <p>And this Providence of God, to find competent food and rayment for all men, the poor as well as the rich, our Saviour illuſtrateth by the example of the Fowls of Heaven and the Lillies of the field, whereof the one, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Fowls, are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently fed, though they neither ſow nor reap; and the other, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Lillies, are as bravely clad, though they neither weave nor ſpin; And yet <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his royalties, <hi>was not arrayed like one of theſe,</hi> nor all the colors in the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> cannot make ſo glorious a ſhow as theſe fading flowers: and <hi>Sarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napalus</hi> Diet,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I have often ſhewed, how ominous it is, to weaken the hands of the Clergie, by keeping away their means to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inable them to do the ſervice of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">

                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="4">4. For the innocent, either <hi>Iriſh Papiſts,</hi> or ejected <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> I fear it may be with many of them, as it was with the <hi>Gibilines,</hi> who being at variance with the <hi>Guelphs</hi> in the City of <hi>Papia,</hi> promiſed to <hi>Facinus Caius,</hi> all the houſes and goods of the <hi>Guelphes,</hi> if he aſſiſted them to get the Victory; which he did; and after he had ſubdued the <hi>Guelphs,</hi> he ſeized upon the goods both of the <hi>Guel hs</hi> and <hi>Gibilines:</hi> and when the <hi>Gibilines</hi> complained, that he brake his covenant, in taking their houſes, and pillaging their goods that were <hi>Gibilines,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Caius</hi> anſwered, It was true indeed, that they were <hi>Gibilines,</hi> but their goods were the goods of <hi>Guelphes,</hi> and ſo belonged unto them, and ſo to him: So, perhaps, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Adventurers, and the greedy Souldiers, may ſay of them, as they do of us of the Church, that they are innocent, and we faithfull to our king; but ours, and their lands and fair houſes, are the lands of Rebels; and therefore, as they do hold ours from us, ſo they will keep theirs from them.</p>
                  <p>But this is no juſtice, nor <hi>to do as you would be done unto;</hi> for, as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to God, <hi>Wilt thou deſtroy the righteous with the wicked?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 18.23.</note> And as <hi>Abimelech</hi> ſaid, <hi>Lord, wilt thou ſtay a righteous nation?</hi> So I ſay, God forbid that any innocent man, be he of what Religion he will, ſhould loſe either houſe or lands.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, The Iriſh Papiſts are not ſo innocent; for though their hands did act nothing, for fear they could not prevail; yet it may be their hearts did earneſtly wiſh, that all the Proteſtants ſhould be rooted out, and perhaps their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or Grandfathers were as deep in rebellion as any other;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:36873:100" rendition="simple:additions"/> and therefore they may be as juſtly deprived of their eſtates, as they would have deprived us.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs that, as when <hi>Croeſus</hi> ſent to the Oracle, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate, why he ſhould be ſo hardly dealt withall, that was ſo bountiful unto the Gods, and ſo faithful a ſerver of them? The Oracle anſwered, That for his bounty the Gods preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his life, but his Kingdom was tranſlated, and his other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction happened for the iniquity of <hi>Gyges,</hi> that was the death of <hi>Candaules:</hi> So God may juſtly puniſh the preſent Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, for the precedent faults of their fore-fathers; as he did cut off ten Tribes from <hi>Rehoboam</hi> for the ſins of <hi>Solomon;</hi> and he that knows our hearts may juſtly whip us for our evil thoughts.</p>
                  <p>But we are not to judge of any man for his thoughts, nor to puniſh him for his wiſhes, until they do break forth either into words or acts; becauſe the other muſt be left alone for God.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, ſeeing that he which condemneth the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, is as abominable to God, as he that abſolveth the wicked, that juſtice ſhould be obſerved, that no innocent man ſhould ſuffer; yet I would not have thoſe deemed Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, that are more then apparently known to be very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
                  <p>There is another degree of juſtice, which ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the oppreſſed <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that have been ejected out of their eſtates, and to our poor neighbours, that are ready to ſtarve in the ſtreets: For, as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eſurientium paenis eſt quem tu detines, nudorum indumentum quod tu recludis, &amp; miſerorum pecunia quam tu in arca abſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condis.</hi> And therefore, though we term it alms, yet it is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in us to do it, and they that are able are unjuſt if they do it not.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The laſt branch of juſtice concerns our ſelves:<note place="margin">The fourth branch of our righteouſneſs.</note> for a man may be unjuſt to himſelf, as all covetous men, and the prodigal perſons are, when as the one hath the bleſſings of God, and hath not the heart to uſe them, and the other doth abuſe them, to the ſhame and deſtruction of himſelf, profuſely wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:36873:101" rendition="simple:additions"/> them in feaſting and drinking, or, as ſome do, in beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their <hi>Tiaras,</hi> and ſome others in ſweeping the ſtreets with <hi>Si ks</hi> and <hi>Velvets,</hi> which are vanities, that I know not how they ſhall anſwer, when they come to appear before Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; and yet we that are the Preachers ſhall be but laught at, for reproving of theſe vanities, and telling them how it is far from that juſtice which we ſhould render unto our ſelves, beſides the abuſe that they offer to Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have ſhewed you what is juſt and righteous, and directed you the right way to the Kingdom of God. God give us grace to walk therein.</p>
                  <p>But you will demand, Where is juſtice without partiality now to be found, among Neighbours, or in the Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or in the Parliament Houſe? I cannot, and I dare not ſay, you ſhall not find juſtice therein; yet this I dare ſay, I have ſeen faction and friends, contrary to juſtice, to have carried things in all theſe places; and therefore, ſeeing that <hi>Injuſtice and Oppreſſion do make wiſe men mad,</hi> eſpecially if they ſee the ſervants of Rebels and Traitors favoured and countenanced, againſt the moſt faithful ſervants of their King, and the Ambaſſadors of the living God: And ſeeing that as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.16.</note> 
                     <hi>I ſaw the place of judgement, and wickedneſs was there; and the place of righteouſneſs, and iniquity was there:</hi> My advice to you all is, to follow our Saviours counſel, <hi>If any man will ſue thee at the Law,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 5.40.</note> 
                     <hi>and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak alſo:</hi> for in ſo doing, in your patience you ſhall poſſeſs your ſouls, and walk in the right way to the Kingdom of God.</p>
                  <p>And then ſecondly, what is here promiſed ſhall be undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly performed, <hi>All theſe things ſhall be adminiſtred unto you,</hi> through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord, to whom be glory, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and thanks, and praiſe for all his mercies and favours for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>And therefore away with them, that do <hi>abridg</hi> and abbrevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the great mercie and favour of God towards his people, as if he were a <hi>reſpecter</hi> of perſons, and ſent his Son to die for <hi>ſome choſen men,</hi> that he pleaſeth to <hi>elect</hi> out of all the reſt of the relapſed poſterity of <hi>Adam;</hi> No, no, beloved, God is no ſuch <hi>niggard</hi> of his Graces: but, as he openeth his hands, and <hi>filleth all things living with plenteouſneſs,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſ. 145.16.</note> and here cauſed the Braſen Serpent to be <hi>lifted up on high,</hi> in the open Wilderneſs and not in a ſecret corner, where all, and not a few, might look up unto it; ſo he gave his Son, to be born in the <hi>Stable</hi> of a publick Inne, where <hi>all travellers</hi> may boldly and juſtly challenge a room to lodg in, and he was <hi>lifted up</hi> and Crucified not in the <hi>walled City,</hi> where the enemies, (as we were all

                     <p>And therefore if any man receives not the grace of Chriſt, <hi>culpa non eſt vocantis ſed renuentis,</hi> the fault is in our ſelves, and not in God, that deſires not <hi>the death of a ſinner,</hi> not taketh any pleaſure in the <hi>miſeries</hi> of his creatures, but tells us plainly <hi>Perditio tua ex te,</hi> becauſe we will not look up to him.</p>

                     <p>It is affirmed by ſome <hi>Naturaliſts,</hi> that if one be poyſoned with the Sting and Venom of a Serpent, the very looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>ſhining Braſs</hi> is preſent death unto him that is ſtinged;
<pb facs="tcp:36873:110" rendition="simple:additions"/> and how then ſhould it be likely to be believed, that the look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the brazen Serpent ſhould or could be the only means to ſave theſe peoples lives, from the venom of the fiery Serpents? Even ſo, when Chriſt told the <hi>Jews,</hi> that, <hi>If he were lifted up from the earth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 12.32.</note> 
                        <hi>he would draw all men unto him,</hi> that is, if he were put to death, his death ſhould give life, or at leaſt be ſufficient to give life, to all men: the people an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>We have heard out of the Law, that Chriſt abideth for ever;</hi> and how ſayeſt thou, That <hi>the Son of man muſt be lifted up,</hi> and ſo by his death reſtore life unto the world: This is a rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to us, not poſſible to be believed, that thy death ſhould preſerve our life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Eſay 55.8.</note>But you muſt know, That <hi>Gods wayes are not as our wayes,</hi> nor his thoughts as our thoughts; for we ſay with the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, that, <hi>Ex nihilo nihil fit:</hi> but God made heaven and earth, and all the things that are therein, <hi>out of nothing,</hi> and he drew the light out of darkneſs, and the beauty and well-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed frame of this univerſal World, out of a rude unſhapen Chaos.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, when God hath appointed and commanded any thing to be done, and promiſed it ſhould produce ſuch and ſuch effect, it is not for us to doubt or to examine, whether ſuch a cauſe can bring forth ſuch effect, or to conſider whether it be likely or unlikely to do the ſame; but we ought to do what God commandeth us, whatſoever it be, and to believe whatſoever he ſaith, and be ſure of whatſoever he promiſeth, how unlikely ſoever it be to be effected: for ſo, when God ſaid unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>Sarah ſhould have a Son,</hi> that is, <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and that ſhe ſhould be the <hi>mother of nations,</hi> and Kings of people ſhould be of her, which ſhould ſpring from <hi>Iſaac;</hi> and afterward bad <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> which made the former promiſe very unlikely, and in mans judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment altogether impoſſible, that he ſhould be ſacrificed and killed, and yet be the father of ſo many Nations: yet ſeeing God commanded him to do it, <hi>Abraham</hi> neither doubted of Gods promiſe, nor diſobeyed his command, but preſently car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him to Mount <hi>Moriah</hi> to be ſacrificed: So when God
<pb facs="tcp:36873:110" rendition="simple:additions"/> commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to lift up his Rod over the Sea, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Sea ſhould be divided,<note place="margin">Exod. 14.16.</note> ſo that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> might go on dry ground through the midſt of the Sea; and ſo likewiſe, when he commanded him <hi>to ſmite the Rock of ſtone,</hi> and promiſed that the waters ſhould flow thereout, which had no poſſibility with all the power of nature to be done; yet <hi>Moſes</hi> never doubted of Gods Promiſe, but preſently did what God commanded both in the one and the other.</p>
                     <p>Even ſo when God commands us to do any thing, and promiſeth we ſhall have ſuch and ſuch bleſſings by doing it; as to have our ſins remitted, by being baptized in a little wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by the worthy receiving of a little Sacramental Bread and Wine, to injoy all the benefits of the body and bloud of Chriſt, and by a ſtedfaſt faith in the death of Chriſt, to be aſſured of eternal life; how unlikely ſoever they may ſeem to be, we ought, with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the reſt of Gods faithful Servants, moſt readily do what God biddeth us, and undoubtedly believe what he promiſeth.</p>
                     <p>And though it may ſeem a ſtrange wonder that cannot ſink into worldly mens heads, that Chriſt his death ſhould procure to us eternal life, and therefore the preaching of this doctrine is to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that looked for ſuch a Chriſt that ſhould abide alive for ever, <hi>a ſtumbling-block; and to the Grecians,</hi> that gloried only in their <hi>eloquence,</hi> and aſcribed all things with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to their natural cauſes, <hi>meer fooliſhneſs,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.23.</note> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle teſtifieth.</p>
                     <p>Yet if you truly weigh this doctrine of our deliverance from eternal death,<note place="margin">How juſt it is, that the death of Chriſt ſhould free all men that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, from eternal death.</note> and obtaining of everlaſting life by the death of Chriſt, we ſhall find it very conſonant to juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and no wayes to be doubted of; and that in a twofold reſpect.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe that although we for our ſins deſerved moſt juſtly to die the death, that is, to ſuffer the eternal wrath of God, whom we have and do ſo highly offend; yet ſeeing it <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> pleaſed Chriſt, out of his great pity to our miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his infinite love to mankind, to become our Surety, and to die, and ſo ſatisfie the wrath of God for us; Is it not

For ſo, when the Officers came to apprehend Chriſt, and to arreſt him, and he asked them, <hi>Whom ſeek ye?</hi> And they anſwered, <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth:</hi> And he ſaid, <hi>I am he;</hi> and if you ſeek me, then let theſe that are my Diſciples, and do believe in me, go their way: It is apparent by theſe words, that Chriſt held it agreeable to all reaſon, that if he paid the debt, the debtor ſhould be free; and if he ſuffered death for us, we ſhould be delivered from that death which we deſerved.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> 2. Becauſe that although the death of Chriſt was but the death of one man and we that ſinned and deſerved death are many thouſand millions of men, even all the poſterity of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> yet the death of this one man, <hi>Propter unionem hypoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam,</hi> by reaſon of the hypoſtatical union of the Godhead with the manhood in the perſon of that one man, whereby he is not only man, but alſo God himſelf, his death being the death of God, muſt needs be of ſufficient worth and value to ſatisfie God, and be more ſatisfactory to his juſtice, then the death of all Men on Earth, and all the Angels in Heaven; in as much as the death of the Creator is of more infinite value then the death of all creatures.</p>
                     <p>And therefore well might Chriſt ſay, and happy are we that he ſaid it, That <hi>the Son of man muſt be lifted up, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life:</hi> And I, if I be lifted up, or being lifted up, will draw all men unto me, that is, all which will believe in me.</p>
                     <p>And ſo you have ſeen, what was typified in the Wilderneſs unto the <hi>Jews</hi> by the brazen Serpent, was preſented and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to us by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> to whom, for his infinite love and favour towards us, and his bitter Paſſion and death, when he was lifted up and crucified for us, to deliver us from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, be all honour, and glory, and thanks, and praiſe for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. That there are many things, that in themſelves, are good in them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That all thoſe good things are perverted and corrupted by them to a perverſe and wicked end: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You muſt underſtand, that by their fall, they have not <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Point. </seg>1</label> loſt all thoſe endowments and excellencies which God had given them in their creation; and whatſoever they do retain, which they have had from God, the ſame is, and muſt needs be good: but their natural ſubſtance, and their natural quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as their knowledge, their underſtanding, wiſdom, agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, inviſibility, immortality, ſtrength, and the like, are all given them by God, and they are the works of God; and theſe in themſelves ſimply conſidered, muſt needs be good; becauſe all that God made were, and ſtill are, exceeding good.</p>
                  <p>And therefore let not wicked men, oppreſſors, Church-robbers, Adulterers, proud perſons, and the like,<note place="margin">That men ſhould not think it enough to have ſome good things in them, but endeavour to be good in all things.</note> think well of themſelves, becauſe they have ſome good things in them: as a good wit, great learning, fair ſpeeches, ſome charity; and it may be ſome juſtice, and the like: for ſo the Devils have ſome good things in them likewiſe; and if thou hadſt no good things in thee, thou wert worſe then the very Devils: But, if thou wouldeſt be deemed a good man, thou muſt be <hi>ex omni parte bonus,</hi> good in every way, or at leaſt endeavouring to be good in all things, ſuch as <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Zacharias</hi> were, that <hi>walked in all the Commandments of God without reproof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. You muſt note, that there is none of thoſe good things <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Point. </seg>2</label> that are in them, but, as wicked Judges abuſe their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to pervert Juſtice; and corrupt Lawyers abuſe their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to wreſt the Law; and covetous worldlings do abuſe their wealth and their power to oppreſs the poor: ſo do theſe wicked ſpirits corrupt and abuſe all the good things that are
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:36873:147"/> in them, by making them means of effecting the greater evils, as by their knowledge and ſubtilty to deceive us, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Evah;</hi> by their might and power to torment us, as they tormented <hi>Job,</hi> and thoſe poor poſſeſſed men that we read of in the Goſpel; and by their agility to be every where, in every corner ready to entrap us. And therefore how wary, and how watchfull ſhould we be to eſcape their wiles, and to prevent them; for the more powerfull our enemies are, the more preparation we ought to make againſt them:</p>
                  <p>But, to the end we may the better ſee how farr, and how many ways they pervert and turn all theſe good things, that God hath given them to work our deſtruction, and to ſhew their rebellion againſt God; let us proceed unto the ſecond point, and ſo conſider the names and titles whereby they are named and made known unto us: becauſe, as the Poet ſaith,

                  <p>Then I went to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſtayed there, and preached <hi>often,</hi> untill <hi>Ireland</hi> was ſurrendred upon <hi>Articles</hi> unto the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and I being by <hi>name</hi> to have the <hi>benefit</hi> of thoſe Articles, and having received a very fair and <hi>conſiderable</hi> ſum of money, by the hands of Sir <hi>George Lane,</hi> from my Lord of <hi>Ormond,</hi> that had <hi>alwaies</hi> ſhewed himſelf a moſt <hi>honourable friend,</hi> and a <hi>boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful</hi> helper and benefactor to me; I reſolved to live upon that ſmall <hi>temporal</hi> means which I had, about twenty pounds a year, in <hi>Wales:</hi> But, after I put my <hi>Books,</hi> and <hi>Cloaths,</hi> and houſhold-ſtuff,<note place="margin">How I was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoner and robbed by Captain <hi>Beech.</hi> And nothing troubled me ſo much as the loſs of a paper Book which I had written, full of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which vexeth me to this very day.</note> and all the <hi>Money</hi> I had, and my ſelf into the <hi>Packet-boat,</hi> to paſs to <hi>Holy Head,</hi> our ſhip was taken, about the middle way, by <hi>Captain Beeche,</hi> and I was <hi>robbed</hi> of all that I had in it, <hi>Cloaths, Books, Money,</hi> and <hi>Houſhold-ſtuff,</hi> and, with a great deal of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty</hi> and favour, I prevailed with <hi>Captain Beeche,</hi> to caſt us all, his Priſoners, upon a little Iſland, called, <hi>Irelands eye,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king there a <hi>fire</hi> that we brought with us from the Ship, we had a boat that carried us into <hi>Hoath,</hi> and from thence we went all to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where Doctor <hi>Loftus</hi> very friendly gave me as much money as carrried me to <hi>London;</hi> and there I petitioned to the Committee for Sequeſtred men, to be <hi>reſtored</hi> according to the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Angleſey</hi> and of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to my means; and one of them, named <hi>Scot,</hi> that ſince hath been <hi>hanged,</hi> demanded, if I had not written the <hi>Grand Rebellion?</hi> and I anſwered, <hi>I did:</hi> then ſaid he, and do you come for performance of <hi>Articles,</hi> that deſerve rather to have your <hi>head</hi> cut off; No, no, ſaid <hi>Corbet</hi> and the Chair-man, let us go to <hi>another matter;</hi> and I, leſt I ſhould be clapt by the heels,<note place="margin">And after the Committee read the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I got them from them to ſhew them to other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee men, and I keep them with me to this very day.</note>

                  <p>But one of my Countrymen had begg'd of his Majeſty the <hi>Deanery of Bangor;</hi> yet, when I informed his Majeſty, that my good King and <hi>gracious Maſter,</hi> his Father, had conferred it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, to hold it <hi>in commendum,</hi> ſo firm as <hi>Law</hi> could make it; his Majeſty was <hi>moſt graciouſly</hi> pleaſed preſently to ſend to Sir <hi>Edward Nicholas</hi> to <hi>recall</hi> the Grant that he had made to Mr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> but the ſame being paſt to the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> my <hi>Lord Chancellour,</hi> to whom I ever was <hi>very much</hi> obliged, knowing my <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> to my late King and beſt Maſter, and my <hi>ſufferings</hi> for him, did <hi>moſt honourably</hi> ſtop it, before I could come unto his Lordſhip; and ſo by his <hi>Majeſty</hi> and my Lord <hi>Chancellours</hi> goodneſs, I ſtill enjoyed my Maſters favour.</p>

He further depoſed, That before the Record was returned into this Court, he had a Copy of the ſaid Original atteſted under the hand of the ſaid <hi>Halpenny,</hi> which he doth find upon examination to be different from the Record now lodged in this Court, by vertue of the ſaid <hi>Certiorari,</hi> and that as this Deponent is credibly informed, and verily believeth, the ſaid <hi>Certiorari</hi> and Record now returned was for the ſpace of one month, or thereabouts, in <hi>Dublin</hi> detained in the hands of Mr. <hi>Patrick Lambert,</hi> who is ſaid to be <hi>Atturney</hi> for Sir <hi>George Ayſcue</hi> Knight, the pretended Proprietor of the premiſes in the Indictment contained, before ſuch time as he returned the ſame, and that this Deponent could not have the ſaid Record returned ere that he had by the Court a conditional fine impoſed upon the Clerk of the Peace, or his Deputy for his neglect in not returning thereof.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. This <hi>frequent</hi> quaſhing of Indictments is a great <hi>encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for Oppreſſors, and wicked men to <hi>wrong</hi> their neighbours more and more; for ſay they, I will enter upon him and thruſt him out, and if he doth <hi>indite</hi> me, I will remove it to the Kings Bench, and I ſhall find a Lawyer that will <hi>quaſh</hi> his Indictment by and by.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This <hi>very practiſe</hi> and proceeding may be feared to prove the very <hi>bane</hi> and deſtruction of whole Nations and Kingdoms: For if Righteouſneſs <hi>exalteth a Nation,</hi> and a Kingdom is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36873:168"/> from one Nation to another People, <hi>becauſe of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, and as we may read it in all Hiſtories. Then you may ſee how requiſite it is, for Kings and Princes, to look to thoſe things, and not to ſuffer <hi>unrighteous Judges,</hi> either for <hi>favour</hi> to one, or <hi>hatred</hi> to another, to do what they liſt, and to make their Laws like a <hi>Noſe of Wax,</hi> to bend which way they pleaſe, or like a <hi>Spiders Web,</hi> that catcheth the <hi>ſmall Flies,</hi> but is broken, by the great <hi>humble Bees,</hi> all to pieces; but to be like the Chancellour <hi>Steel,</hi> that although he hated my perſon, yet, he ſaid, though I deſerved it not, I ſhould have Juſtice, and ſo he did me Juſtice preſently, and I love to do right to my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and to ſay the truth of mine enemy.</p>
                     <p>But for my ſelf, I thank God for it, as I lived <hi>many years</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quietly and contentedly with far <hi>leſs means</hi> then 20 <hi>li.</hi> a year, and with far leſs pains and troubles then I have now, ſo I doubt not, but I could live ſo ſtill; and I reſolved and vowed, as I have atteſted in my Epiſtle to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> that, if I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this <hi>Biſhops Court</hi> unto the Church, I would <hi>wholly</hi> and <hi>fully</hi> beſtow the ſame for the repairing of the <hi>Cathedral</hi> Church of <hi>Kilkenny:</hi> So that <hi>recovering</hi> it, I ſhould not be one Penny the richer, or <hi>not recovering</hi> it, not a Penny the poorer; and ſo the wrong done by this <hi>Proceeding,</hi> whoſoever did it, is, as I conceive, more againſt the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> than againſt my ſelf.

                  <p>For if you walk through <hi>Ireland,</hi> as I rode from <hi>Carlingford</hi> to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and from <hi>Dublin</hi> to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and in my <hi>Viſitation</hi> thrice over the Dioceſs of <hi>Oſſory;</hi> I believe that throughout all your travel, you ſhall find it as I found it, in all the waies that I went, ſcarce <hi>one Church</hi> ſtanding, and <hi>ſufficiently</hi> repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for ſeven, I ſpeak within compaſs, that are <hi>ruined,</hi> and have only <hi>walls,</hi> without ornaments, and moſt of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>roofs,</hi> without <hi>doors,</hi> without windows, but the holes to receive the winds to entertain the Congregation.</p>
                  <p>And what a <hi>lamentable</hi> thing, and a miſerable-fight is this? If you ſay, that in the time of blindneſs the people were <hi>over zealous</hi> in building <hi>too many</hi> Churches, and thinking to merit much thereby: I ſay, that now, in the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of knowledge, and the Sun-ſhine of the Goſpel, they are <hi>too riotous</hi> to pull them down, and <hi>too negligent</hi> of Gods honour, and of the Peoples good, to waſte and ruinate ſo <hi>many Churches,</hi> and to let the people <hi>want</hi> them to meet together, to ſerve God; which will merit a worſe reward for them, than they ſhall have that built them.</p>

And ſo did the reſt of the Clergy loſe <hi>very much</hi> by reaſon of their Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, which they had never been acquainted with ſince my reſtauration; though I received not forty ſhillings from <hi>all my Clergy</hi> ſince I came to be Biſhop to this very day, nor ſo much as <hi>one penny</hi> from the Dean in all my life.</p>
                     <p>Then about two months after the <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> Viſitation was paſt, I received a Letter from Mr. <hi>Proby,</hi> the Archbiſhops Regiſter.</p>
                     <p>And therein a Liſt of them that had not paid their Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations unto his Grace.</p>
                     <p>At the reading of which, I did <hi>greatly</hi> wonder at the <hi>partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of Archdeacon <hi>Bulkley,</hi> that could ſpare to ſequeſter Mr. <hi>Richard Seagar,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whittington,</hi> Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Deane,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goburne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> that were the Deans friends, and for whom he interceded, though five of them were non-reſident, and yet would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſequeſter thoſe eight (whereof ſeven were alwaies reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and took moſt pains in all the Dioceſs,) whom he knew the Biſhop therefore had a very <hi>good opinion</hi> of them, as well as of thoſe whom he ſpared; and the Dean had ſo <hi>eagerly,</hi> I will not ſay <hi>maliciouſly,</hi> but I dare ſay <hi>cauſeleſly,</hi> complained of them; and theſe alſo to have their <hi>Relaxations</hi> granted before they had paid their <hi>Procurations;</hi> I hope it is not to ſequeſter them <hi>again,</hi> which they well <hi>deſerve,</hi> if their former warning hath not <hi>taught</hi> them to pay them. And therefore, I that have <hi>alwaies</hi> perſwaded and taught <hi>obedience</hi> to be obſerved by all inferiours to their <hi>ſuperimendents,</hi> would not be <hi>negligent</hi> of my
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36873:204"/> duty, to do according to my Lords Grace his Order, but I ſent my <hi>Apparitor</hi> to all the particulars of my Clergy mentioned in the Schedule, to come and make <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for their Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or to expect what might <hi>ſucceed,</hi> which they were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, like wiſe men, to <hi>prevent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And they, when they came unto me, ſhewed me their <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittances,</hi> under Mr. <hi>Juxe</hi> his hand, that they had already paid them.</p>
                     <p>So I thought this <hi>ſtorm</hi> was over: Yet within a while I heard that about ſome ten poor <hi>Pariſh Clarkes,</hi> and five of the Clergy were cited to appear at <hi>Dublin,</hi> (a journey to ſome fifty or ſixty miles, in the ſhort Winter daies, and over waies as foul as any is in <hi>Ingland,</hi>) to anſwer <hi>Articles</hi> that ſhould be objected againſt them.</p>
                     <p>Then divers of the <hi>Clerks</hi> came crying to me, that they had rather leave their <hi>Clerkeſhip</hi> than to take ſuch a journey to <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin;</hi> and one of the Clerks the Archdeacon <hi>Bulkley</hi> had given a Licence to, and yet cited him to <hi>Dublin</hi> to ſhew his Licence, the which, when he ſhewed, the Officers of the Court ſaid, they <hi>miſtook</hi> it, and diſmiſt the cauſe, and yet afterwards ſent a Citation for the <hi>Fees.</hi> And my Clergy entreated me to <hi>intercede</hi> for them that did not know wherein they had <hi>offended,</hi> nor what could be <hi>objected</hi> againſt them: and I anſwered them all, that I would neither meddle nor make in their buſineſs; but, if they have done well, then all would be <hi>well,</hi> if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, let them ſuffer for it, I would never <hi>excuſe</hi> their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, nor <hi>Patronize</hi> their offence; then ſome of them appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at <hi>Dublin,</hi> expecting their Charge, and deſiring earneſtly to be diſpatcht, Archdeacon <hi>Bulkley</hi> anſwered, Your Biſhop is writing of Books, (for he had ſome inkling of mine intent,) and will not apply himſelf to my Lords Grace to <hi>intercede</hi> for you.</p>
                     <p>Yet my Lord Archbiſhop very <hi>nobly</hi> and <hi>graciouſly</hi> willed the Archdeacon to take their <hi>anſwer,</hi> and to diſpatch them that they might go <hi>home;</hi> and the Archdeacon <hi>Bulkley</hi> willed them, to <hi>confeſs</hi> their faults, and to ſubmit unto the Court, and they ſhould be diſcharged; and I hearing of this advice, willed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36873:205"/> them to confeſs the <hi>truth,</hi> but not of any guilt, wherein they were <hi>innocent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore when they had their Articles, ten or twelve, read unto them, (for they had no Copy of them,) they ſaw, they were but meer <hi>ſuggeſtions,</hi> and not any thing in any of them, that could any waies touch them, or prejudice them in any thing, and they preſently made their anſwers unto them.</p>
                     <p>And when they had anſwered and confeſt <hi>no fault</hi> that they committed; upon the payment of their Fees, for the charges of the Court, they were diſmiſt.</p>
                     <p>Whereby, it ſeems to me, that, if they were guiltleſs, and nothing could be proved againſt them, they might as well cite all the Clergy, and all the men in <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and ſuggeſt Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles againſt them, to bring them unto <hi>Dublin,</hi> to pay <hi>Fees</hi> to enrich the Officers of the Court; and that being done, to ſend them home <hi>glad</hi> that they are diſmiſt.</p>
                     <p>Then after this the Churchwardens of S. <hi>Maries</hi> in <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> having very juſtly, as I underſtand, <hi>preſented</hi> divers perſons at the Archbiſhops Viſitation,<note place="margin">Canon 65. and 67.</note> they were, contrary to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> cited to appear at <hi>Dublin,</hi> forty ſeven miles, to make good their Preſentation, as the Churchwardens informed me; which was ſo ill reſented, that we could <hi>hardly</hi> get any that would take the <hi>Churchwardenſhip</hi> upon them, for fear of the like troubles if they preſented any man. But, when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the Archdeacon why the Churchwardens were cited to make good their Preſentment: He anſwered, it was not ſo; but they retained a <hi>Proctor</hi> to proſecute againſt thoſe that refuſed to pay the <hi>Church taxes,</hi> and they not following their ſuit, they were ſent unto, either to come and <hi>proſecute,</hi> or the Defendants ſhould be <hi>diſmiſt:</hi> which if ſo, I blame not the proceeding, but let the Churchwardens ſuffer for their own errour, when they ſue out of my Court without a diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or an appeal.</p>
                     <p>Yet out of all <hi>my former diſcourſe,</hi> it appeareth what an <hi>heavy burthen</hi> and an infinite charge this laſt triennial Viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Archbiſhop hath been to the <hi>indigent Clergy</hi> of <hi>Oſſory,</hi>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:36873:205"/> both in their <hi>threefold</hi> Procurations, their <hi>manifold</hi> Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and <hi>long</hi> Winter journeys to procure their Relaxations, and the <hi>manifold</hi> loſſes that they ſuſtained by their Tenants, that, by reaſon of the Sequeſtrations were diſappointed of thoſe tythes that they had taken from the Incumbents, which makes me think, that we do not follow our Saviours Counſel and Precept to S. <hi>Peter, To feed his flock;</hi> nor what we learnt in the old Adage, that ſaith, <hi>Boni paſtoris eſt pecus tondere non deglubere;</hi> for certainly theſe foreſaid things do ſeem <hi>deglubere pecus non tondere;</hi> and to cauſe his ſhepwards to <hi>ſtarve,</hi> and not to enable them to <hi>feed</hi> his Lambs.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, as the ſin of <hi>Solomon</hi> moved God to raiſe up <hi>Hadad</hi> the <hi>Edomite,</hi> and <hi>Rezon</hi> the Son of <hi>Eliadah,</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> to vex <hi>Solomon</hi> for the ſins of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> 1 Kings 11.14, 23, 26. So I do not wonder, that God ſuffereth the devil to ſtir up <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Why God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to vex the Biſhops.</note> and other <hi>Anabaptiſtical</hi> Sectaries to vex the <hi>Biſhops</hi> for theſe and the like ſins of the Biſhops againſt God and his poor people, when they ſuffer and <hi>countenance</hi> their Commiſſaries, Regiſters, and other Officers, to be like a <hi>talent of lead</hi> upon the necks of Chriſt his Sheep.</p>
                     <p>But I do therefore demand, if theſe things,<note place="margin">Whether the foreſaid abuſes ought not to be redreſſed.</note> and all the things I ſhewed to be amiſs in this Treatiſe, ought not to be <hi>reformed</hi> and amended?</p>
                     <p>I know ſome will ſay, they ought not <hi>thus</hi> to be publiſhed to the World, to diſcover the weakneſs and <hi>imperfections</hi> of our Brethren, to make them <hi>more contemptible</hi> in the eyes of the ſcoffers of our Calling, than they are; and therefore will much <hi>blame</hi> me for this my publication of theſe things.</p>

                        <hi>publiſhed</hi> to their ſhame: therefore it is far better to <hi>diſcover</hi> the faults of Governours and great men, than to <hi>conceal</hi> them; becauſe it is done,<note place="margin">Why great mens faults ought to be diſcovered.</note> not with any deſire of <hi>any evil</hi> to the doers of thoſe evil deeds, but out of an earneſt endeavour to <hi>amend them,</hi> and to prevent the like carriages in all others; not to diſgrace <hi>any,</hi> but to prevent the diſgrace of <hi>all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But though it be not amiſs to make <hi>known</hi> the injuſtice and the faults of Great men, that there may be a <hi>redreſs</hi> of them; yet who dares complain and ſpeak of the Vices of their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours? <hi>An tutum eſt ſcribere in eos qui poſſunt proſcribere:</hi> I have read how the Mice held a <hi>Conſultation,</hi>

                     <p>Yet here I would not have my Reader to imagine that I ſpeak for the eaſe or remittance of the Procurations, Taxes, or other Impoſitions, of them that hold the Abbies, Priories, and Impropriate Rectories, which they have for nothing, and as it appears to me, contrary to all divine right; and therefore ſhould pay the ſame continually every year to them that do the Service of God: but I ſpeak it only for the eaſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the poor incumbent Rectors and Vicars that labour and take pains for the good of Gods people, and for the ſaving of their ſouls that hold their means from them.</p>
                     <p>And, if this may not be done, to reduce the Government of the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> to the ſame form, and after the ſame manner as the Church of <hi>Ingland</hi> is governed, yet that the Archbiſhops and Biſhops ſhould take ſpecial care to ſee that their Surrogates, Chancellours, and Deputies ſhould not any waies to enrich their Friends, Officers, and Servants, and to feaſt themſelves, oppreſs the poor Clergy, and others the poor Servants and Officers of the Church of Chriſt. I doubt not,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:36873:209"/> but the Biſhops and the Archbiſhops are all juſt, and merciful, and tender-hearted towards all their inferiour Clergy; and can no waies be juſtly blamed for the faults of their ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Officers or Deputies, which they are ignorant of; And I do profeſs without flattery, and in the word of a Chriſtian, that my Lords Grace of <hi>Dublin,</hi> in all that he did, or ſaid, was ſo noble, juſt, and gracious towards thoſe honeſt Clergy men, whom his Archdeacon ſo ſeverely trounced, that the leaſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the leaſt blame cannot be laid upon him.
